INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR K4 BULLETIN BOARD

/*********** INSTALLATION ***********/

To install, copy the files to your webserver. Make sure that the 'sqlite' and 'template' directories are underneath 
your document root. The rest of the files, in this case, all of the files within the 'public_html' folder can be 
copied to any new folder above your document root (ie: public_html/,public_html/k4/, etc). before installing, if you
are on a webserver on the internet, make sure you know your FTP username, password and server. Without this knowlege,
the forum will not be able to change the file permissions on any of the templates, upload areas, etc. Now, go into
whatever browser you use, frankly I prefer Firefox to any other, and navigate to where you put your forum. it should
redirect you to the /Install folder and a file called 'install.php'. Now, just fill out all of the necessary 
information, click 'Install it Baby', or whatever buttons are down there, and you're good to go. The install will
refresh itself through several steps, and when it's finished, it will be quite evident. Once the installation is
finished, you will need to wither rename or delete the 'Install' folder. You will find that if you're using SQLite 
as your database type, it has created a database hopefully in your 'sqlite' folder (under the document root), and 
that it has created a file called 'install.lock.php'. This file is required for the forum to work, and if it does 
not exist, then you either have to mock one up, or delete the database and re-rename the 'Install' folder. Well,
You should be good to go, so have fun!

/*********** STYLESETS ***********/
The 'k4 Stylesets' folder includes all of the currently available Stylesets for k4. Not only can k4 look great on
its own, but it can look like any other bulletin board system out there! All of the necessary images are currently
in k4, so don't worry about those! Here's what you do with them: Copy them to somewhere on your computer. After you
have installed the forum and done all of that other stuff, log in as the user that you set in the installer. Then,
click the 'Admin Panel' button on the rightmost side of the navigation bar. It will pop open the Admin Control Panel.
Once you are in the ACP, click on the 'CSS' link on the left navigation bar. It will load a page with all sorts of
things in it. Scroll down to the bottom of that page, and look for anything that says 'Import'. There will be a file
field. Click it, navigate to one of the stylesets, and click 'Import'. It will do the rest!
